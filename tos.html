    <p>Before you start playing, Please take a few minutes of your time to read our Terms and Conditions (TOS).</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Use (“Terms”, “Terms and Conditions”, "TOS") carefully before using the Rocky Reborm website (the “Service”) operated by The Rocky Reborn Team (“us”, “we”, “our”, "Rocky Reborn", "Rocky Team").</p>

    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

    <p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

    <h2>Links To Other Web Sites</h2>
    <p>Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Rocky Reborn.</p>
    <p>Rocky Reborn has no control over and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Rocky Reborn shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>
    <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend access to our Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.</p>
    <p>All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.</p>
    <p>The gxmes provided by this site are considered to be from the public domain, e.g. they are widely found on many other sites, etc., and comply with second party site’s policies. Please note that Rocky Reborn does not own any of the gxmes. We try our best to give as much credit back to those authors/owners/organizations etc. as possible. But if you believe such a gxme should not be featured on our website, please contact the Developer Team (through our contact form) and we shall arrange to take off the gxme as soon as possible. Usually within 24-48 hours.</p>
    <p>All visitors may enter and play multiplayer games at their own risk.</p>
    <p>Rocky is NOT responsible for anything that may offend anyone in general.</p>

    <h2>Proprietary Rights of the Gxmes</h2>
    <p>Most of the published gxmes are submitted or suggested to us by people who did not create the gxmes. Rocky cannot confirm if they have respected the other intellectual properties or rights. Upon receiving notification in accordance with any related copyright organization or owner, The Rocky Rebron Team will immediately disable and remove the gxme in question.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States/Any Country without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 5 days’ notice before any new terms take effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
    <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you disagree with the new terms, please stop using the Service/Website.</p>

    <h2>Changes About Proxies For People From China</h2>
    <p>The Rocky Team recently found out that the proxies that we have on our website were banned for the country of "People's Republic of China". So any users that use the proxies that we have on our website in the country of "People's Republic of China" are using proxies banned by the "People's Republic of China". According to The laws in The "People's Republic of China" using non-government-approved VPNs (Proxies) is illegal. So before using one of our proxies in China, please rethink this action.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about these Terms Of Service, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us at: <a href="mailto:Rockygamesdevteam@gmail.com">Rockygamesdevteam@gmail.com</a></p>

    <p>Thank You For Taking Your Time To Read The Rocky Reborn TOS.</p>
